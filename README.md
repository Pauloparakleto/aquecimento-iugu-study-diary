# Study Diary
## A study diary running totally on Bash
This version organizes the system commands inside the `system_helper.rb`, such as `clear` and `clear_and_wait_key_press` methods.

The `diary_study.rb` file only call all methods it needs from `study_item.rb`.

The `menu` method is now just to show the menu and the input was delegated to `choose_an_option` method.

## Disclaimer

As the topic was about OOP, I took the day between the next class to solidify it. I hope on the next version implementing saving a file with items.
